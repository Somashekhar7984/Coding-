/*
    Expedi(Expedition):
        A group of Cows grabbed a truck and ventured on an expedition deep into the jungle.
        The Truck leaks one unit of fuel for every unit of distance it travels.
            To repair the truck , The Cows need to be drived to the nearest Town(Not More than 10^6 units distance)
        On this Road, between the town and the Current Location, There are N (1 <= N <= 10^5) fuel Stops where the cows
        can stop to acquire additional fuel
            (1,2,3,4.......100 units at each stop).
        The Cows ward to make the minimum possible number of stops for fuel on the way to town.
        Capacity of the tank is sufficiently large to hold any amount of fuel.
            Initial units of fuel : P (1 <= P <= 10^6)
            Initial distance from town : L 

        Determine the minimum no of stops to reach the town??
