    Directed Graph : A graph with directed edges is known as Directed Graph
    Un-Directed Graph : A graph with un-directed edges is known as Un-Directed Graph
    Adjacent Vertices : Adjacent Vertices are two vertices with direct edge connecting them
    Degree of a vertex : Two types of DEGREES
        In-Degree  : Number of incoming edges to a node
        Out-Degree : Number of out-going edges from a node
    Path between two vertices:
        All vertices which come in the path of two given vertices is called their path.
        eg: path between 1 and 4
                1-->3-->4

    Connected Graph:
        Each node has path from every other node
    Dis-Connected Graph:    
        Each node does not have path from every other node.

    Connected Components:
        Each Connected Graph in a disconnected graph is called a Connected Component.

    Cycles in a Graph:
        Path from a vertex to the same vertex in a graph is known as cycle

        Cyclic Graph:
            Graph that contains cycle is called cyclic Graph
        Acyclic Graph:
            Graph that does not contain cycle is called acyclic graph 

    Tree:
        Tree is connected acyclic graph

        Properties of a tree with n nodes:
            1.  Number of nodes n-1
            2.  There are no cycles present
            3.  Each node has path from every other vertex

    Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG)
        As the name suggests, its properties are:
            1. Its has directed edges
            2. It is acyclic i.e. no cycles are present

    Complete Graph:
        A Graph in which each vertex is connected to every other vertex by a direct edge.

            no of edges in a complete graph = nC2 = n(n-1)/2

    Weighted Graph:
        A Graph with weighted edges is called weighted graph
